# React useEffect Hook Missing Dependency

This repository demonstrates a common error in React applications involving the `useEffect` hook: missing dependencies in the dependency array.

## Bug Description
The `MyComponent` component uses the `useEffect` hook to log a message when the `count` state variable exceeds 5.  However, the dependency array `[count]` is missing a dependency, resulting in the effect running only once after initial mount and not on subsequent updates of `count`. This leads to the conditional logic inside `useEffect` failing to execute when `count` becomes greater than 5, even if it does.

## Solution
The solution includes the correct dependency array in `useEffect`, ensuring that the effect runs whenever the `count` value changes.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Observe the unexpected behavior (the console message does not appear even when count exceeds 5)
5. Compare with the `bugSolution.js` file to see the corrected code.

This example highlights the importance of carefully considering which values should be included in the dependency array for useEffect to ensure correct and predictable behavior.
